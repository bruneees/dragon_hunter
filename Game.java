/**
*  This class is the main class of the "Dragon Hunter" application. 
*  "Dragon Hunter" is a very simple, text based adventure game.  Users 
*  can walk around some scenery. That's all. It should really be extended 
*  to make it more interesting!
* 
*  To play this game, create an instance of this class and call the "play"
*  method.
* 
*  This main class creates and initialises all the others: it creates all
*  rooms, creates the parser and starts the game.  It also evaluates and
*  executes the commands that the parser returns.
