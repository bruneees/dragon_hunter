# dragon_hunter
You are a warrior princess and you have been sent into a castle to kill the dragon thatâ€™s keeping the prince hostage. The dragon is hiding in one of the rooms of the castle (the rooms are very big ) and carrying the scared prince with him wrapped around his tail. This dragon has notoriously hard scales which can only be pierced with the legendary "Sword of Goremack" that is stored in one of the castle rooms. Beware: if you dare to face the dragon without the sword you will meet your doom! To avoid a fiery death, place your hands on the door you plan on entering to feel the temperature of the room. 

**Rules for the player**
Every room has:
1. A description.
2. A group of doors you can pass through (exits).
3. Possibly an item. 

Win condition: Kill the dragon and save the prince. 
Lose condition: Face the dragon without a sword and die.

**You can run the game by compile and then running the Applicattion.java class**
